Compilation of PMUL Script Policies

Role Based vs. Script Based Policies

A Privilege Management for Unix and Linux policy server is either in Role-Based or Script-Based policy mode. A server in Role-Based mode only uses role-based policy and ignores all script policies. A server in Script-Based policy mode only uses script policies.

First time I've need to install a PM in Linux, I've found not so many examples and script policies available
